     <h2>Dedication</h2>
<p>To the Lord Jesus Christ;
And to the Servant and Apostle of God Prof. E. H Guti; we believe without any iota of doubt that 
God indeed raised a prophet, an apostle, a father of all and above all, a bond servant of Christ 
who does not do things from his own mind but from God;
To our mother Dr E Guti for encouraging us and this ministry to take up the vision and have the 
spirit of this church;
Finally to all postgraduates and undergraduates who want to rise up and be counted throughout
Zimbabwe and the nations across as sons & daughters of the great apostle E. H Guti.</p>

<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>It is of paramount importance for any member or leader of this ministry to know that this ministry 
has come to this far through the obedience of our father Apostle Prof. E.H. Guti to the simple 
message (FEAR NOT SIN NOT) that he received from God more than half a dozen of decades ago 
and also due to prayer, fasting and love. </p>
<p>In this ministry, the founder’s main message, “Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His 
righteousness and all these things will be added unto you”, Mathew 6:33, makes this ministry 
unique. The message has been preached from time immemorial without dilution regardless of the 
fact that the preaching methodology is changing due to such things as instruments, internet and 
gospel channels like Ezekiel T.V among other things. Any member or leader who shall come into 
this ministry shall not therefore seek to change the message due to technological and 
methodological dynamics instead they should pass the baton stick as it is to the next generation.</p>
<p>Leaders in this ministry are not supposed to be seen fighting with the main constitution (rules and 
policy) of F.I.F. as it has to be clear to any one that this ministry is a byproduct of F.I.F as such it 
has to be seen to be augmenting the rules and policy of our church. Any leader or member 
therefore who shall knowingly move a motion to propose issues that are contrary to rules and 
policy should know that he or she has denied the faith due to the simple fact that our God is not 
the author of confusion. The other leaders or members should correct that lost member with love 
knowing that they can also make similar mistakes. </p>
<p>God sets people into leadership positions and disempowers them, thus, once one is made to be a 
leader in this ministry, one should strive to serve faithfully in this world where the world is crying 
for faithful and true leaders (Guti, 1995). A great leader according to the teachings of our Lord 
Jesus Christ is the one who reduce one’s self to be a servant. Prof. Guti always says that a good 
leader is the one who is not a boss.</p>

<p>Leaders and members of this ministry are implored to pray and plan for this ministry. Failure to 
plan and pray is a good enough recipe for failure. Prayer ensures that God is involved in our plans 
and hence success is guaranteed. Without God, planners should know that their plans are but 
vanity. A good example can be drawn from our father Prof. E.H Guti who declined to accept money 
and buses from a white man prior to consulting his God in 1972 in America.</P>


<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<h2>1.1 History and Formation</h2>
<p>F.I.F University Graduates Fellowship (U.G.F) formerly known as Postgraduates’ Fellowship,
a ministry which was started through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to the Archbishop and the 
Founder of ZAOGA F.I.F Prof. E. H. Guti in 1991 with the first university on board being Zaoga 
society at University of Zimbabwe, now called Zaoga on Campus across all. </p>
<p>The main mission is for the graduates to preach their peers in order to fulfill our Lord Jesus Christ’s 
greatest commission, Mathew 28: 16-18. The ministry which has its dominance in Zimbabwe is 
projected to reach the whole world and where ever it is just like the mother church, it is self￾supporting, self-administering and self-propagating. </p>
<p>The God of our Father E.H Guti has made it that we Zimbabweans are being sent out through 
skills transfer and we need to tape on this enormous breakthrough for the fastest growing 
international ministry. Therefore, in-order to achieve this we plan to create a sub-web page on 
FIFMI.org with (UGF) Graduates contact database and platform to assist the missionary office’ 
outreach program, for oversees contacts, tent makers and missionaries in other countries at the 
click of a button. </p>
<p>While, in July 2012, after successfully putting our heads together we elected a steering 
committee and proposed a name change which was communicated to our Father Prof. E.H Guti. 
A discussion was carried out during the meeting of where to start from after the Postgraduates 
Fellowship died a natural death due to a leadership vacuum and lack of membership, which gave 
birth to the idea of incorporating all Zaoga on Campus (ZOC) undergraduates’ university 
students.</p> 
<p>As agreed by all members of the University Graduate Fellowship and the following requirements 
were spelt out; The FIFMI University Graduate Fellowship shall or would comprise of:</p>
<li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> <span>Former students who have gone through universities and obtained first degrees / 
post higher degrees.</span></li> 
<li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> <span>And, also those students who are still at Universities studying to have their degrees 
(Undergraduates). Membership is not limited to Zimbabwean students but also all 
members of F.I.F internationally.</span></li>
